# Feedback Most Welcome

## That's All, Folks!

You've reached the end of this e-book.  Now the onus is on you to take our advice and make good use of it between now and when you graduate.

## Tell Me Your Story

Has this book helped you?  I've love to hear how.

Please write to me with your success stories, your horror stories, and your feedback on things that I need to update or additional things that we need to cover for next year's edition.  You can reach me at if-i-knew-then-book (at) stuartherbert dot com, and I look forward to hearing from you.  Or you can reach all of the authors via the [Voices From Industry](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/111699457416495663696) community on Google+.
